1. *** Introduction **************************************************

 VNC is a great and famous remote control, multi-OS tool, created at
 the ATT Research Labs de Cambridge-http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc

 This Ultr@VNC version is based on:
 - RealVNC 336 & 337
  and includes:
 - Most of eSVNC 1.1.2 r2 functionnalities
 - Most of Vdacc-VNC functionnalities
 - Cursor handling code and Tight encoding from TightVNC
 - VNC QuickDesk toolbar code
 - And various code modifications coming from talented developpers.

 - Since v1.0.0 RC 12, Ultr@VNC FileTransfer can transfer whole Directories
  For this it uses "zip32.dll" and "unzip32.dll" dll files and source code
  coming from the Info-Zip group. Please see at the end of this
  document (section 7.) for details about these dlls
  Update: Since the 1.0.5.2 Release, these 2 dlls are no more needed

 - Since v1.0.0 RC 12, the viewer Toolbar looks more professionnal, thanks to
  Lim Chee Aun (http://www.phoenity.com/) who has designed it.

 Ultr@VNC brings tons of functionnalities and high performances even
 over modem connections.

 Many thanks to all people who help us developping, testing, stabilizing,
 answering users questions and animating the forum and the mailing list

2. *** Features *****************************************************

* Supported Operating Systems: Win9x/Me/NT4/2000/XP/2003/VISTA/7

* Auto configuration and Quick Options for easy connections.

* Viewer Toolbar for a quick access to the main functions and greatly
improved ergonomy.

* High Speed. On W2000, XP, Vista and 7, Ultr@VNC can use an additional and 
optional Video Driver (aka Mirror Driver) that dramatically improves performances
and reduces CPU load over LAN connections. So when the bandwidth
is good - typically over a LAN - Ultr@VNC lets you work on a remote
computer with an incredible 'real-time' feeling (hundreds of screen
updates per second), just as if you were sitting in front of it. A
WinVNC server under Win9x uses the standard hookdll in combination
with ddi hooking to improve the updates handling. 
Ultr@VNC also features an ultra fast Fullscreen Polling mode without any 
additionnal driver.
Whatever the connection speed, Ultr@VNC brings you optimal comfort.
Note that this driver is distributed separatly from Ultr@VNC.

* Embedded File Transfer with intuitive Graphical User Interface allowing
for easy file copy between local and remote computers. It uses the current
VNC connection and files are compressed during their transfer.
File transfers can be asynchronous so screen updates can continue while
a file is being transfered in background.
The delta transfer mode allows to resume interrupted transfers.

* MS Logon/NT security support. You can manage server access using MS Users,
Domains and Groups. It also includes a logging feature where all actions are
written to a log file.

* Bandwidth Saving Strategies that provide optimal responsiveness over slow
connections: Server Screen Scaling, Cache Management , Local Cursor handling,
reduced colors modes (256, 64, 8, Grey scales).

* Advanced JavaViewer featuring FileTransfer, MSLogon and reduced color modes.

* Data Stream Modification Plugin System allowing any kind of operation on the
data exchanged between client and server, from an external DLL (independant,
not linked and not distributed with Ultr@VNC): additionnal rights checking,
communication timing, data recording/persitence, encryption...
it's up to the DLL developper.
Several encryption plufgins are available on the web.

* Optional "always-on-top" Viewer Status Window dynamically displaying
connection informations.

* Various View Modes including Full-Screen, Scaled and Windowed. Full-Screen
mode lets you see the remote screen on the entire screen of your display.
Scaled Viewer mode lets you see the scaled remote screen in a window with a
user defined size. Scaled Server mode generates less network traffic from
server side and use a pixel blending algorithm to optimize the display.
Fuzzy Mode combines Server and Viewer scaling to provide reasonable visual
comfort and speed even over very slow connections.
The Autoscaling mode scales the view so it fits the viewer screen.

* Dynamic Single Window/Full Desktop view switching, from viewer side.
* Server's Desktop resolution switching without disconnection.
* Dynamic Mouse and Keyboard locking on remote server, from viewer side.
* Server Screen Blanking, from viewer side

* Embedded Client/Server Text Chat.

* Possibility to send Ctrl-Alt-Del to the remote server
(when WinVNC is run as a service), or any other special key.

* Support for 32/24/16/8 bits colors.
Both Ultr@VNC Viewer and Server are compatible with RealVNC, TightVNC, eSVNC,
PalmVNC2 (with server scaling feature)...
Ultr@VNC server can work as a Service under all supported operating systems,
allowing remote user Logon/Logoff as well as Remote Shutdown.

* Connectivity: Standard Viewer and HTTP JavaViewer connections over TCP/IP,
as well as XDMCP direct X11 connection (still experimental).

 7. Details

 * How does Ultr@VNC use Info-Zip

  Ultra WinVNC and vncviewer both use 2 dlls for Directory Transfer
  (Note: from v1.0.5.2 these libraries are embedded into the exes)

  * Zip32.dll
  It is the original Info-Zip Zip 2.3 version (without encryption) that
  can be found on the Info-Zip sites, as well as its source code:
  http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/
  http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/
  ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip

  * Unzip32.dll
  Has been compiled using the portable unzip550 source code that can be
  found on the Info-Zip sites:
  http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/
  http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/
  ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip
  THE ONLY thing that was modified is that the "crypt.c" and "crypt.h"
  files have been replaced with the dummy (null) ones coming from the
  Zip 2.3 sources. So this unzip32.dll IS NOT the original Info-Zip
  "unzip32.dll" and does not contain any encryption/decryption code or binary.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For any bug/pb regarding the use of these dlls by Ultr@VNC (Directory
  Transfer), please only send mails to Ultr@VNC team (http://ultravnc.sf.net)
